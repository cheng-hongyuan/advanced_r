Download the source file from [*Compile Hadleyâ€™s Advanced R to a PDF*](http://brettklamer.com/diversions/statistical/compile-hadleys-advanced-r-programming-to-a-pdf/). Install R Package dependencies using `devtools::install_github("hadley/sloop")` and `devtools::install_github("hadley/emo")`. Finanlly, use `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", output_format = "bookdown::pdf_book")` to compile the book.

First of all, upgrade RStudio and installed packages to the latest version. During the building process, I've met several problems. The followings are the errors I've met and how I solved them. 
  
  ## warning :you have install R 

when I open Rstudio to combile this book, Rstudio warning I donnot install R.But i had installed it two days ago. to solve tis problem. make sure two apps are installed in same file. lastly, open Rstudio use mannagerial authority

  ##connect Rstudio with Git
  open Rstudio ,click tools--global options,put you Git.exe into Git/VSN 

  ##install R packages
  In Rstudio, it alert updating loaded packages.at first, I click "yes" to run. had wrong.
  last, click "no", it is finished.

  ##'dplar'
  the following objecrs are masked from 'package:stats':
  filter, lag
  the following objecrs are masked from 'package:stats':
  intersect,setdiff,setequal,union

  In Rstudio ,input  >library('dplyr')  and list information above. Then I input < suppressMessages(library('dplyr')) to remind Rstudi output wrong informations.
  ## Quitting from lines 223-235 (Introduction.Rmd) 

  open introduction.Rmd with Rstudio, reshape commend line in 234,add 'encodeing = "UTF-8"' in () 
  change line 234 to > contributors <-read.csv("contributors.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE, encoding = "UTF-8")

  ## Quitting from lines 80-81 (Names-values.Rmd)

  find your package 'rlang' in ../Rstudio/library, remove or drop it, and reinstall it.

  ##git clone https://github.com/hadley/adv-r.git

  git clone have no problem. but when I do it in GitBush, it success install in fourth time. But do it with Rstudio just cost thirty seconds.
